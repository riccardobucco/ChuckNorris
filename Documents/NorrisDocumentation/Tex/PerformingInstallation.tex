\level{2}{Performing the installation}
	First, make the app directory your working directory. Then use the following npm command:
	\begin{lstlisting}
		$ npm install norris --save
	\end{lstlisting}
	This will create the \texttt{node\_modules} directory (if one doesn't exist yet), and will download the package to that directory. It will also add the package to the dependencies in \texttt{package.json} (unless it was already there).\\
	You might want to add Norris temporarily, just to it out, without adding it to the dependencies list in the \texttt{package.json} file. Just avoid using \texttt{--save} flag:
	\begin{lstlisting}
		$ npm install norris
	\end{lstlisting}

	\level{2}{Norris} \label{sec:ObjectsDescriptionNorris}
		After you've created an instance of Norris, you can set some options. More specifically, you can change some functions' behavior. In other words, it's possible to pass your own functions so that Norris will use it instead of the default one.\\
		You can change the behavior of the following functions:
		\begin{description}
			\item[login] This method is called when a client tries to connect to the instance of Norris. The default login function always returns true.
			\item[logout] This method is called when a client tries to disconnect from the instance of Norris. The default logout function always returns true.
			\item[isLogged] This method is called when a client makes a request to the instance of Norris. The default isLogged function always returns true.
			\item[keepAlive] This method is called when a client renews its connection (in order to not be disconnected). The default keepAlive function always returns true.
		\end{description}
	\level{2}{Pages}
		After you've created a page into an instance of Norris, you can set some options. You can change the following properties:
		\begin{description}
			\item[title] This is the title of the page. It's a String.
			\item[maxChartsRow] This is a number which sets the maximum number of charts inside a row of the page. The default value is 2.
			\item[maxChartsCol] This is an integer number which sets the maximum number of charts inside a column of the page. The default value is 3.
		\end{description}
	\level{2}{Charts} \label{sec:ObjectsDescriptionCharts}
		In this section it's described the format that every \insglo{JSON} object should follow when they are used inside a chart. You may use them in the following situations:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item addition of data during the chart's inizialization;
			\item addition of settings during the chart's initialization;
			\item addition of new data during the different updates.
		\end{itemize}

		\level{3}{Data inizialization}
			When you are creating a chart and you want to add some data, make sure to set the properties of the \textbf{Data} object described below, with the right format.
			\level{4}{Bar chart and Line chart} \label{sec:dataBarLine}
				The Data object of a Bar Chart or Line Chart has the following “name/value” pairs:
				\begin{description}
					\item[labels] This is an array of items, which have String type. It indicates the values of the “x” axis (dependent values of the chart). Note that this property is mandatory.
					\item[datasets] This is an array of objects. Every object represents a set of bars (in a Bar Chart) or a line (in a Line Chart). They have the following properties: 
					\begin{description}
						\item[name] It's a String, which describes the name of the bar set (in a Bar Chart) or of the line (in a Line Chart). 
						\item[color] It's a String which represents the color of the specified bar set (in a Bar Chart) or line (in a Line Chart). It uses the hexadecimal, six digits, notation for the Red, Green and Blue values. 
						\item[values] It's an array of numbers which indicates the dependent values corresponding to the values of the “x” axis in a given bar set or line. The length of this array must be the same of that of the labels array. Note that this property is mandatory.
					\end{description}
				\end{description}
				Note that the “labels”, “dataset” and “values” properties are mandatory, and when you want to specify a color you neccesarily have to indicate at least the value of “r”, “g” and “b”.
			\level{4}{Map chart}
				The Data object of a \insglo{Map Chart} has the “datasets” property, which is an array of objects with the following “name/value” pairs.

							\item[y] It's a number that represents the latitude;
							\item[id] It's a String for arbitrary text containing notes about the described point.
						\end{description}
				\end{description}
				Note that the “values” properties is mandatory, in particular “x” and “y” are indispensable. Different series can have a different number of points.

					\begin{description}
						\item[color] It's a String which represents the color of the specified bar set (in a Bar Chart) or line (in a Line Chart). It uses the hexadecimal, six digits, notation for the Red, Green and Blue values. 
						\item[background] It's a String with the same properties of “color” but it sets the background color of the cell.
						\item[value] It's a String which represents the text of the cell.
					\end{description}
				\end{description}
				You have to keep in mind that the “headers”, “datasets” and “values” properties are mandatory. Moreover, the length of each array contained in datasets must be the same of that of “headers” array.
